    "    Build a classifier to classify product titles. We want to classify an input product title into categories.\n",
    "    Training data to classify this product into categories is provided with the problem. The categories\n",
    "    assigned in the training data are the only categories to be considered.\n",
    "    Also provided is a set of product titles where your classifier should predict the relevant labels. We\n",
    "    will internally evaluate the classifier on the prediction on the test data set.\n",
    "    Please provide all the relevant pre-processing, model development and tuning code.\n",
    "    Few points\n",
    "    1. Itâ€™s a tab separated file. The first column is the title, the second column contains labels.\n",
    "    2. There are multiple labels in the 2 nd column but for this exercise you can consider only one\n",
    "    label. If you want you can set it up as a multi label classification problem but its ok if you do\n",
    "    not.\n",
    "    3. Simplify the problem if need be.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Dataset Understanding ####\n",
    "\n",
    "Training dataset has two columns\n",
    "    1. Titles - text description of the particular product\n",
    "    2. Labels - Multiple labels separated by tab.\n",
    "        2.1 First Value is **Category** it belongs to.\n",
    "        2.2 Values followed by First values are **Macro categories** that can tag under the labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Approach ####\n",
    "\n",
    "Breakdown of the problem\n",
    "    1. First step is to separate the label into **Major Category** and macro categories.\n",
    "          1.1 function `separateLabels` from the notebook is to separate the labels into categories and macro categories\n",
    "          \n",
    "    2. Once the macro labels are separated from the labels, next step is convert into one-hot encoding. Because, multiple products can tag to multiple macro labels. converting into one-hot encoding variable is best choice for this case. \n",
    "          function `convertIntoMultiLabel` is to separate the macro labels creates one-hot encoding representation of the data and append to the original dataset.\n",
    "          \n",
    "    3. In the dataset, there are lot of duplicates records were found. **Removed all those duplicate records**.\n",
    "            `df.drop_duplicates().reset_index()` does the Trick\n",
    "            \n",
    "    4. The major step is to preprocess the input data ie.., \"titles\" from the dataset. To preprocess the text these are the steps that are carried out\n",
    "        4.1 Convert all text to lower case.\n",
    "        4.2 Replace REPLACE_BY_SPACE_RE symbols by space in text.\n",
    "        4.3 Remove symbols that are in BAD_SYMBOLS_RE from text.\n",
    "        4.4 Remove stop words.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      after all these steps carried out, we will get text with absence of stopwords, special characters and numbers. In our case, I didn't consider numbers because, the numbers just represent the volume of the product. From the data, volume doesn't help us to categorize the products.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     5. Modeling the Data\n",
    "         5.1 For now, only considering problem as **Multi-Class Text Classification** Problem. \n",
    "         5.2 First step is to, check the words vocabulary in the dataset. In our dataset, there are 20109 Unique words. \n",
    "         5.3 Check the class count in the dataset and class imbalance. \n",
    "         5.4 Convert the data into vectors (or) sequence of integers and pad the input sequence if the length is too small.\n",
    "         5.5 Convert the target label **category** into numerical records(label encoding)\n",
    "         5.6 Do Train and Test Split\n",
    "         5.7 Choose the appropriate Machine Learning Algorithm with better model performance. \n",

    "### Dataset Behaviour ###\n",
    "\n",
    "In our dataset, there are 254 Categories as targets and the proportion of those dataset are highly imbalanced. For example, Category **Snacks** has 26% ratio in the train dataset and other categories has different proportion of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exactly **108** category instance has data less than 10 records which the dataset has huge imbalance. Without thinking any further my first approach was to **capture the features per categories**. To capture the important feature per each category, used **Unigram and Bigram Method(BOW) model**. \n",
    "\n",
    "After capturing Bag of Words, I inspected whether each class has separate features that can be linearly separable. **BOW** can seen in the text file **word_grams_to_category.txt**. In this text file, we can observe that some category has unique keywords cannot seen in another categories. So, in this case **MultiNomial Naive Bayes** algorithm works better. \n",
