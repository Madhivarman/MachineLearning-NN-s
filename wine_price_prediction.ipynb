      "Description:A nice Zinfandel that's dry and fruity, with briary, brambly blackberry, tobacco and spice flavors. It's a clean, vibrant Zin, but a very tough, tannic one. Needs ultrarich fare to crack through the astringency.\n",

      "Description:A very fine effort, with classic cassis and black cherry in the fruit core, but also offering interesting details of bark, earth and herb. The wine lingers, perhaps due to excellent natural acidity, and without overpowering the palate it keeps tantalizing it with nuances of moist earth and wet rock.\n",

In the mouth, however, this wine is softer and plusher than you'd expect. Sure, that trademark Barbera acidity is present, but its natural sharpness has been dulled.\n",

      "Description:Another fine value from Kirkland, the Costco house brand. Vineyard sources are first rate, mostly Wahluke Slope, and the wine has exceptional grip, depth and structure for Merlot at this price point. Cassis, dark plum, black cherry, licorice, espresso and smoke are woven together nicely. Tannins are lush, substantial and quite ripe; they wrap up the wine with a blanket of smoke and tar. A great steak wine.\n",
      "Predicted:15.579015731811523, Actual:10.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Description:A very good Chardonnay, fancy and elegant, although it's a little sharp in the mouth, and lacks a certain hedonistic appeal, especially at this price. Shows dry, oak-inspired flavors of pineapples, green apples and pears, with a firm minerality.\n",
      "Predicted:41.729061126708984, Actual:46.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Description:Representing a good value in top-flight Cabernet, Jim Barry's 2008 The Cover Drive (a cricketing term) features subtle hints of cinnamon, coffee and vanilla layered over blueberry and plum fruit. It's on the full-bodied side, with plush, velvety tannins balanced by crisp acids. Drink now–2018.\n",
      "Predicted:15.33321475982666, Actual:18.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Description:A top value, this full-bodied yet supple Shiraz packs in the flavor, starting with dark, brooding fruit on the nose, developing intensely flavored mixed berries on the palate and finishing warm and long. Drink now.\n",
      "Predicted:14.728950500488281, Actual:19.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Description:Smooth and sophisticated with rich blackberry and plum aromas backed by oak-driven tones of spice and leather, this is a very rich expression of Barbera (that sees eight months in oak barrels). The overall effect is excellent and the mouthfeel culminates with bright tones of prune and crushed black pepper.\n",
      "Predicted:26.054277420043945, Actual:20.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Description:Crisp red apples and tight fruit skins give this wine a taut, lively character. Just a touch of caramel to broaden the acidity.\n",
      "Predicted:7.153879642486572, Actual:18.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Description:Gold in color, with an ebullient nose of spiced melon and sweet flavors of candied pineapple tinged with white pepper and grapefruit. At 12.5% alcohol and 117 g/L residual sugar, it's rich and sweet without being over the top. Drink now.\n",
      "Predicted:21.573095321655273, Actual:19.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Description:Winemaker Joe Forest has brightened the fruit and livened up the mouthfeel by blending in 20% Grenache. Fresh raspberry flavors are wrapped into the earthier, herbal, lightly chocolaty character of the Syrah. Once-filled French barrels were used.\n",
      "Predicted:18.540462493896484, Actual:25.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Description:It's unfortunate that only 56 cases of this wine were imported, so be sure to snag it when you see it. Intense and powerful on the nose, with attractive forest, licorice, tea leaves and menthol adding complexity to the small red berries and plum skins. The velvety texture and firm structure lead nicely into the mocha-flavored finish, with flecks of white pepper gleaming through on the very end.\n",
      "Predicted:27.62860107421875, Actual:37.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Description:This winery, part of the San Pedro group, is on the right path as its wines have improved in recent vintages. This particular wine marks a high-water point; the nose mixes dry wood notes, leather, herbal berry and even some fine aged cheese. The palate is tight and forceful, with cassis, cherry and cola flavors. Powerful but poised. Drink now through 2012.\n",
      "Predicted:21.911802291870117, Actual:23.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Description:Back on form after the disappointing 2008, Nobilo's Icon deftly combines hints of honey and stone fruit with a leafy overlay of herbal flavors. It's medium bodied, with a finish that's tinged with tobacco leaf. Drink now and over the next 6–9 months.\n",
      "Predicted:20.75953483581543, Actual:20.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Description:Sidewood's consulting winemaker, Nathasha Mooney (who made the still-stunning 1998 E&E; Black Pepper Shiraz while at Barossa Valley Estate), is putting together some excellent wines that also represent good value, including this grapefruit-scented Sauvignon Blanc. This medium-bodied offering is long and intense, blending citrus with minerally spice reminiscent of white pepper.\n",
      "Predicted:15.17461109161377, Actual:16.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Description:This Bordeaux blend shows an interesting range of fruit flavors and textures from the blend, which includes Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot and Merlot. The flavors tend toward red fruits, as in cherries and red currants, while the tannins are quite strong. Shows an immaturity now that strongly suggests 5–6 years in the cellar.\n",
      "Predicted:69.7039566040039, Actual:65.0 \n",
      "\n",
      "Description:This is a rich and chocolaty expression of Barbera d'Alba with thick concentration and immediate aromas of black currant and cherry. The wine is dense and extracted with smooth, drying tannins and a piquant blast of acidity on the close.\n",
